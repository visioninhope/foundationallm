# Agents

Foundationa**LLM** (FLLM) agents are the core of the solution. They are responsible for orchestrating the interaction between the user and the underlying data sources. There are several components that comprise an agent through configuration as an agent consists of metadata that describes the agent and its data sources, the data sources themselves, and the LLMs that are used to generate responses. Below is a list of the different types of agents that can be configured in FLLM:

- [SQL database agents](sql-database-agents.md)
- [Azure AI Search Service agents](search-service-agent.md)
