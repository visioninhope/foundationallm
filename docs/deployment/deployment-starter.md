# Deployment - Quick Start

Foundationa**LLM** is designed for seamless deployment within your Azure Subscription. It initially utilizes Azure Container Apps (ACA) for rapid deployment and streamlined development. For scaling up to production environments, FoundationaLLM also supports deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), offering robust scalability and management features.

Be mindful of the [Azure OpenaAI regional quota limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits) on the number of Azure OpenAI Service instances. To optimize resource usage, FoundationaLLM offers the flexibility to connect to an existing Azure OpenAI Service resource, thereby avoiding the creation of additional instances during deployment. This feature is particularly useful for managing resource allocation and ensuring efficient Azure OpenAI Service quota utilization.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following resources and access to deploy the solution:

- Azure Subscription: An Azure Subscription is a logical container in Microsoft Azure that links to an Azure account and is the basis for billing, resource management, and allocation. It allows users to create and manage Azure resources like virtual machines, databases, and more, providing a way to organize access and costs associated with these resources.
- Subscription access to Azure OpenAI service: Access to Azure OpenAI Service provides users with the ability to integrate OpenAI's advanced AI models and capabilities within Azure. This service combines OpenAI's powerful models with Azure's robust cloud infrastructure and security, offering scalable AI solutions for a variety of applications like natural language processing and generative tasks. **Start here to [Request Access to Azure OpenAI Service](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUNTZBNzRKNlVQSFhZMU9aV09EVzYxWFdORCQlQCN0PWcu)**
- Minimum quota of 65 CPUs across all VM family types: Azure CPU quotas refer to the limits set on the number and type of virtual CPUs that can be used in an Azure Subscription. These quotas are in place to manage resource allocation and ensure fair usage across different users and services. Users can request quota increases if their application or workload requires more CPU resources. **Start here to [Manage VM Quotas](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests)**
- App Registrations created in the Entra ID tenant (formerly Azure Active Directory): Azure App Registrations is a feature in Entra ID that allows developers to register their applications for identity and access management. This registration process enables applications to authenticate users, request and receive tokens, and access Azure resources that are secured by Entra ID. **Follow the instructions in the [Authentication setup document](authentication/index.md) to configure authentication for the solution.**
- User with the proper role assignments: Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles are a set of permissions in Azure that control access to Azure resource management. These roles can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure, allowing granular control over who can perform what actions within a specific scope, such as a subscription, resource group, or individual resource.
    - Owner on the target subscription
    - Owner on the app registrations described in the Authentication setup document
